# YetAnotherKerbalController
This repository contains the Python and C++ code of my Kerbal Controller project v1

The C++ code must be compiled and uploaded to an Arduino board (see the beginning of the file for the pin configuration)
The Python script must be running in parallel to Kerbal Space Program (change client url if required, i.e. the script is not running on the same machine as KSP)
